The Application known as  Birthday Reminder does not collect any data.
All data that the user provides is stored within the app itself. 
The app can be used to store data that may be sentive ;however, the only way
to access this data is to have root access to your phone or the intruder must actually 
must have your phone. The app does not collect any money because I wanted this application 
to be free since it happense to be my first program on the Play Store.This application
does not connect to any servers and was programed using the java programming language. I used shared Preferences to store 
all data in this application.

You are free to study the source code on my git hub as well. Just remember that if you 
choose to modify this app, you must give credit to me and if you decided to make money with it somehow,
then I am entitled to 10 percent of all sales comming from the derivative application.

Have a nice day!
